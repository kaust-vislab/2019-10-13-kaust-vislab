  The Visualization Core Lab will host an <em>Introduction to SQL for Data Science</em> workshop. 
  Visualization lab staff will provide an introduction to SQL for data science designed for 
  learners with little or no previous experience with SQL programming.
</p>

  Topics covered will include
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Selecting data</li>
  <li>Sorting and removing duplicates</li>

  This is a live-coding based workshop and learners are expected to bring their own laptops with the required software and data already downloaded and installed.
</p>

<p>
  The workshop will curriculum largely follow the 
  <a href="http://swcarpentry.github.io/sql-novice-survey/">curriculum</a> developed by 
  <a href="{{site.swc_site}}">Software Carpentry</a>. Software Carpentry aims to help researchers 
  get their work done in less time and with less pain by teaching them basic research computing 
  skills. This is a live-coding based workshop and learners are expected to bring their own 
  laptops with the required software already downloaded and installed.
